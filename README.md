<Introduction to research methods, Milestone 5>

General information:
- Topic: Creating numerical data to differentiate genres (research between romance and fantasy)
- Significance: Creating data to differentiate different genres in novels from each other. This might help to compute and assign genres for novels using a program. This could be helpful in bookstores to categorize books more easily. It could also be helpful for selling books, where using a customer's preferences a new book can be recommended based on the genres of books. There are certain levels of genres and how much those become focal points, even among the same genre, there are fast differences, but if you could calculate a genre score, you could find books more closely related to that level of genre. Thus creating a greater understanding of differences between genres in novels.

Research question and hypotheses:
- Research Question:
  - Comparing Romance novels and fantasy novels, how many words in novels are only seen in one and not the other genre?
- Hypothesis:
  - There is a difference in the frequence of unique words found in fantasy novels that are not found in romance novels and unique words found in romance novels that are not found in fantasy novels.

Method:
- Independent variables:
  - [Romance novels], [Fantasy novels]
- Dependent variables:
  - Frequency of unique words found in:
    - [romance novels and not in fantacy novels], [fantacy novels and not in romance novels]
- Gutenberg Dataset
