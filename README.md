<Introduction to research methods, Milestone 5>

General information:
The goal of the research is to create numerical data to differentiate genres, in this research there is a focus on the defference between romance and fantasy novels.
If there is data to differentiate different genres in novels from each other, it might help to compute and assign genres for novels using a program. This could be helpful in bookstores to categorize books more easily. It could also be helpful for selling books, where using a customer's preferences a new book can be recommended based on the genres of books. There are certain levels of genres and how much those become focal points, even among the same genre, there are fast differences, but if it becomes possible to calculate a score for different genres, customer's could find books more closely related what they prefer. Creating a greater understanding of differences between genres in novels.
